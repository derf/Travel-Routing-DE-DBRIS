Travel::Routing::DE::DBRIS 0.09 - Mon Feb 23 2026

    * Increase default timeout to 20 seconds to deal with bahn.de's WAF now
      delaying most requests by about 10 seconds.

Travel::Routing::DE::DBRIS 0.08 - Fri Feb 06 2026

    * Deutsche Bahn have rolled out a rather aggressive Akamai EdgeSuite
      WAF configuration, and too-frequent requests made with this module
      may cause the corresponding IP address or range to be blocked for
      yet-to-be-determined amounts of time. Send more plausible requests
      with randomized user agent strings and additional headers to maybe
      hopefully slightly reduce the risk of this happening.
